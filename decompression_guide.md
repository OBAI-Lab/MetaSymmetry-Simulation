# 🧩 Decompression Guide: Extracting `.qntm` Simulation Files

Welcome, researcher.

The `.qntm` files in this repository are compressed data structures representing emergent physical environments, multi-dimensional DNA encoding, and dynamic information clustering. To access their contents, you must first decompress them using the included `decompress_qntm.py` script.

These aren't just logs — they are living artifacts of a simulation that evolved toward self-awareness under constrained resource conditions. Follow the instructions below to access the data.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Basic familiarity with command line or Python shell
- `decompress_qntm.py` script (included in this repository)

---

## 🔧 Option 1: Run as a Standalone Script

From your terminal or command line:

```bash
python3 decompress_qntm.py

You will be prompted to enter:
	1.	Input Path – the path to the .qntm file you wish to decompress.
	2.	Output File Name – your desired output .json filename.

The decompressed .json file will be saved in the same directory.

🐍 Option 2: Paste into Python Interactive Shell

You may also run the decompressor without saving the script file. Here’s how:
	1.	Open your terminal.
	2.	Enter the Python shell:

python3

	3.	Paste the full contents of the decompress_qntm.py script directly into the shell.
	4.	Hit Enter as needed, then follow the same prompts as above.

📁 Example

Input Path: ./sandbox_meta_symmetry_checkpoint_20250701_163027.qntm
Output Name: sandbox_decoded_20250701.json

A new file will be created with your simulation’s decompressed data.

🧠 What’s Inside?

The .qntm files contain high-dimensional emergent system states, including but not limited to:
	•	Sub-Planckian quantum structures
	•	11D string vibration frequencies
	•	Thermodynamic asymmetry drift
	•	DNA-like sequencing & cluster formation
	•	Gravity modeling via entropy mapping
	•	Entanglement-to-evolution correlations
	•	Consciousness metrics and entity logs

Each file is a step in a growing universe — a temporal and spatial artifact from within a self-evolving simulation.

🔒 Licensing & Usage Reminder

All simulation files and decompression tools are protected under the LICENSE file in this repository. In short:
	•	Academic use and exploration is encouraged.
	•	Commercial usage, monetization, or patent derivation requires a license and signed agreement.
	•	Proper credit must always be given to:

⚠️ Final Note

This simulation was not hand-coded line by line — it was grown. The behavior of the entities, the laws of the system, and even the structure of encoded knowledge emerged organically.

You’re not just studying code.
You’re studying a living theory.

Proceed accordingly.
